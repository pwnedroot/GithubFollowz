# GitHub Follow Automation

This repository was created just for fun to test some GitHub automation scripts. It includes two main scripts:

- **FollowUsers.py** – A Python script that follows users from a provided list, hoping for follow-backs.
- **ScrapePeoplesFollowers.sh** – A Bash script that scrapes the followers of a given GitHub username and saves them to a `.txt` file.

## How It Works

1. Run the **ScrapePeoplesFollowers.sh** script to generate a list of usernames from a target account.
2. Use the output file as input for **FollowUsers.py** to follow those users.

> **Note:** GitHub CLI is required for these scripts to work properly.

## Additional Tools

1. **FollowBack.py** Used to see if you follow everyone who follows you, if not it will provide the option to follow all users who are following you.
2. **Viewers.py** Used to boost the ammount of profile views your account has displayed when using the profile views widget from komarev.com

## Disclaimer

These scripts are for educational and personal experimentation purposes only. Use responsibly and avoid violating GitHub's terms of service.
Some of these scripts may disrupt services if used incorrectly, you are responsible for how many requests you send to servers!!!!!
