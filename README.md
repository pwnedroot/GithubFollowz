# GitHub Follow Automation

This repository was created just for fun to test some GitHub automation scripts. It includes two main scripts:

- **FollowUsers.py** – A Python script that follows users from a provided list, hoping for follow-backs.
- **ScrapePeoplesFollowers.sh** – A Bash script that scrapes the followers of a given GitHub username and saves them to a `.txt` file.

## How It Works

1. Run the **ScrapePeoplesFollowers.sh** script to generate a list of usernames from a target account.
2. Use the output file as input for **FollowUsers.py** to follow those users.

> **Note:** GitHub CLI is required for these scripts to work properly.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are for educational and personal experimentation purposes only. Use responsibly and avoid violating GitHub's terms of service.
